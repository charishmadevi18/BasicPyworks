# BasicPyworks
This repository contains Python basics like variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, and file handling. It also includes mini-projects: an ATM system, a calculator, and a supermarket simulation. A complete collection of my Python learning and practical applications.


This repository includes my journey in learning Python, with an introduction to core concepts such as variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, and file handling. It also showcases my practical experience through mini-projects, including:

ATM Project: A simulated ATM system with basic operations like balance checking, withdrawals, and deposits.

Calculator: A simple calculator built with Python for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Supermarket Project: A project to simulate supermarket transactions, including billing and inventory management.


This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my Python learning progress and practical applications. Feel free to explore and contribute!
